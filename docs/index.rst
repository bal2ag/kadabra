Kadabra - Metrics for Humans
====================================
A decision made without data is worthless. It is speculative and often
inaccurate. Data gives you confidence that your application works as expected,
and that changes you make have the impact you expect. Simple metrics can
provide tremendous insight.

It should be simple and intuitive to use metrics in your application, and they
should have a minimal impact on your application's performance. Furthermore,
you should be able to take advantage of metrics without having to pay.
[TODO point about expense of metrics]

Kadabra is a framework that makes it easy for humans to use metrics. It
exposes a simple interface for recording counters and timings in your
application, and provides a performant and unobtrusive way of recording
those metrics in a backing store.
