Kadabra Changelog
=================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Kadabra release.

Version 0.3.0
-------------
- Support for Python 2.6, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and PyPy
- Changed RedisChannel's message format, no longer uses Base64 encoding, as it
  was only increasing message size (not sure why I implemented it in the first
  place). This means existing installations of 0.2.0 will need to make sure
  their Redis servers are empty (no in-queue or in-progress metrics) before
  upgrading. Need to avoid this kind of change in the future, and potentially
  version the messages themselves to prevent unhelpful crashes.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

First public release that actually works, packaged properly.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

First public preview release.
